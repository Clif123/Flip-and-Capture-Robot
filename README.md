# Flip-and-Capture-Robot

## Description
The goal of the project is to build an autonomous robot that is able to carry out a series of tasks on the competition arena. The robot has to collect one puck at a time from the puck collection zone at the center of the arena. Then it would need to transport the puck to the puck capture zone through certain zones in the arena. At the puck capture zone, the robot would need to deposit the puck depending on the colour assigned to it at the start. The robot also has to make sure that it will not collide with any obstacles in the arena. The robot is designed to autonomously repeat the tasks above within the time limit of 5 minutes. 

In order for the robot to carry out the tasks described above, the robot has to have consistent navigation back to the desired section in the arena, identifying the colour of the puck, puck gripping and flipping mechanism and obstacles avoidance
